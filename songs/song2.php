      <h3>Beautiful Scars<br>by MAXIMILLIAN</h3> 
<pre>
  Broken all the pieces I've been shaping lately
  Focused on the things that didn't make no sense
  Guess that growing up was never meant to be easy
  Yeah, I got used to doing everything sideways
  Didn't really care about how anyone felt
  Hiding my emotions down in different ashtrays
  
  Oh, but what is lost ain't gone
  No, you can't just let go
  'Cause it's a part of you that will make you strong
  Embrace your flaws
  
  I'm not gonna fight back what I've become
  Yeah, I've got bruises where I came from
  But I wouldn't change if I could restart
  I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars
  I've been going way too hard on myself
  Guess that it's the reason I've been feeling like hell
  But I wouldn't change if I could restart
  I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars
  
  I went down a road that only got me nowhere
  I've seen every corner, every inch of this place
  Being all alone it really got me thinking, maybe overthinking
  
  That what is lost ain't gone
  No, you can't just let go
  'Cause it's a part of you that will make you strong
  Embrace your flaws
  
  I'm not gonna fight back what I've become
  Yeah, I've got bruises where I came from
  But I wouldn't change if I could restart
  I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars
  I've been going way too hard on myself
  Guess that it's the reason I've been feeling like hell
  But I wouldn't change if I could restart
  I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars
  
  Hide these beautiful scars
  Hide these beautiful scars
  
  I'm not gonna fight back what I've become
  Yeah, I've got bruises where I came from
  But I wouldn't change if I could restart
  I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars
  I've been going way too hard on myself
  Guess that it's the reason I've been feeling like hell
  But I wouldn't change if I could restart
  I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars
  
  Hide these
  I ain't gonna hide these
  Hide these
  Hide these beautiful scars
  No
