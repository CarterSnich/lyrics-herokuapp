      <h3>10, 000 Hours<br>by Dan+Shay & Justin Bieber</h3> 
<pre>
  Do you love the rain? Does it make you dance
  When you're drunk with your friends at a party?
  What's your favorite song? Does it make you smile?
  Do you think of me?
  
  When you close your eyes
  Tell me what are you dreaming?
  Everything, I wanna know it all
  
  I'd spend 10,000 hours and 10,000 more
  Oh, if that's what it takes to learn that sweet heart of yours
  And I might never get there but I'm gonna try
  If it's 10,000 hours or the rest of my life
  I'm gonna love you (Ooh)
  
  Do you miss the road that you grew up on?
  Did you get your middle name from your grandma?
  When you think about your forever now
  Do you think of me?
  
  When you close your eyes
  Tell me what are you dreaming?
  Everything, I wanna know it all
  
  I'd spend 10,000 hours and 10,000 more
  Oh, if that's what it takes to learn that sweet heart of yours
  And I might never get there but I'm gonna try
  If it's 10,000 hours or the rest of my life
  I'm gonna love you (Ooh)
  I'm gonna love you
  
  Ooh, want the good and the bad
  Everything in between
  Ooh, gotta cure my curiosity
  
  Ooh yeah, I'd spend 10,000 hours and 10,000 more
  Oh, if that's what it takes to learn that sweet heart of yours (Yeah, sweet heart of yours)
  And I might never get there but I'm gonna try (Yeah)
  If it's 10,000 hours or the rest of my life
  I'm gonna love you (Ooh)
  I'm gonna love you, yeah (Ooh)
  
  And I'm (Do you love the rain? Does it make you dance)
  Gonna love you (I'm gonna love)
  I'm
  Gonna love you
