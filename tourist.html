        <h1>Boracay Philippines</h1>
        <img src="/storage/emulated/0/Tourism/boracay.jpeg" style="width=100%">
        <p>The centre of the action is dreamy White Beach, a 4km, postcard-perfect stretch of sand lined from one end to the other with hotels, restaurants, bars and dive shops several blocks deep. The beach path is typically awash with visitors, including large groups of package tourists. The ocean is full of romantic paraws (an outrigger sailboat) giving rides; colourful parasails fill the air. After perfect sunsets, live music breaks out, and fire dancers twirl their batons.</p>

        <h1>Eiffel Tower of Paris</h1>
        <img src="/storage/emulated/0/Tourism/Eiffel Tower.jpeg" style="width=100%">
        <p>If it’s your first time in Paris, going up the Eiffel Tower is a must. Visitors can choose to go up using the Tower lift or the stairs. However, before making your mind up on how you want to visit the monument, it is important to keep in mind that there are 1,665 steps to the top.

If you decide to take the stairs, you can only visit the second floor. Although the stairs admission ticket is cheaper, the difference is not worthwhile and we recommend taking the elevator.

The best moment to enjoy the breath-taking views of Paris is early in the morning to avoid the lines or at dusk, when visitors will see Paris lit up.</p>

        <h1>Golden Gate Bridge</h1>
        <img src="/storage/emulated/0/Tourism/golden gate bridge.jpeg" style="width=100%">
        <p>Arching across San Francisco Bay, joining San Francisco and Marin County, the Golden Gate Bridge has been a California icon since it was built in the 1930s. Contrasting with the blue water, the bridge's orangish-red color is an aesthetic accent that brings a unique quality to the city. It also has a unique presence when it is shrouded in fog with just the peaks of the main towers projecting through the low lying cloud. </p>

        <img src="/storage/emulated/0/Tourism/palawan island.jpeg" style="width=100%">
        <p>Palawan consists of 1,780 islands of pristine white beaches, dramatic rock formations, secret coves, and underground mysteries. An untamed land, a nature lover's paradise, and an adventurer's dream: Palawan certainly lives up to its image as the last frontier.</p>

        <img src="/storage/emulated/0/Tourism/jeju island.jpeg" style="width=100%">
        <p>The pinnacle of the chain of islands that festoon South Korea’s southern coast is Jeju Island (often referred to as Jejudo). It’s easy to see why this island is enduringly popular with both local and international tourists alike: it offers volcanic crags to explore, innumerable palm-fringed beaches, lush paddy fields interspersed by tangerine groves and an idyllic rural life. If you think Hawaii or Bali, and add a large splash of South Korea, then you’ll probably already be adding Jejudo to your bucket list!</p>
